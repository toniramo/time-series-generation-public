# time-series-generation-public
Public repository to provide auxiliary material for the "Analysis of multivariate time-series generation methods" project. The project is part of the course "Analyzing the changing world" (LSI32004) of the University of Helsinki. 

The code is based on the repository [Conditional-Sig-Wasserstein-GANs](https://github.com/SigCGANs/Conditional-Sig-Wasserstein-GANs). Additionally, the visualizations of t-SNE and PCA are based on the script available at [TimeGAN](https://github.com/jsyoon0823/TimeGAN/blob/master/metrics/visualization_metrics.py).

Contents:
- [Project report](Time-series_generation_Rämö.pdf)
- [Implementation](./src)
- [Numerical results](./src/numerical_results/) of the best runs
- [Datasets](./src/datasets) and their preprocessing notebooks
